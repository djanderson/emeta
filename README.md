Gentoo ebuild metadata parsing script (written 2005)

Like all good scripts, this one started out with a clear and simple purpose, and quickly got completely out of hand. I continued hacking at it as an exercise in *nix powertools (sed, awk, grep, etc). I eventually rewrote this in Python, and it became the meta module of Gentoo's equery tool (released as part of my major rewite/refactor of gentoolkit 0.3.0).
